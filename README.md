# dust3r-tinygrad
dust3r converted to use Tinygrad instead of Pytorch. Training almost certainly does not work, this has only been tested with the metal backend. You probably shouldn't use this.

I couldn't be bothered to port the code for visualizing the output to tinygrad, so I saved the data with pickle and imported it in the torch version of dust3r, so there is no demo.
